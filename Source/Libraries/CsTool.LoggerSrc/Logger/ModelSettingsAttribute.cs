    /// Originally all properties to be stored and retrieved from a configuration file were collected in a single class 
    /// per DLL or application whereby that class inherited CommonSettings and DefaultSettings to streamline loading and
    /// saving of the properties. The concept is now expanded to abstract the process through the use of attributes and
    /// reflection. With the presence of attributes System.Reflection may be harnessed to automatically determine which
    /// properties need to be saved and loaded.
    /// Since the ModelSettings class may contain properties that are themselves classses there is a little more to it.
    /// Hence we have the following attributes:
    ///     ModelSettingsClass      This attribute identifies the class as an export/import property. it is applied at the
    ///                             class definition level for any class that might be used as a settings property to another
    ///                             class.
    ///                             All class instances are represented by a single XML Element within the xml file under the
    ///                             Root Element. The Root Element defines the application or DLL associated with the settings.
    ///     
    ///     ModelSettingsInstance   This attribute is assigned to an instance of a class that should be treated as a setting.
    ///                             Properties with this attribute assigned generate an XML Element then each settings property
    ///                             within this instance are then saved or retrieve from the XML file.
    ///                             
    ///     ModelSettingsProperty   This attribute is assigned to a property that should be saved and loaded. The property
    ///                             may also be a class instance (String is a class) hence why there is a need to use a specific
    ///                             attribute to distinguish between a literal property versus a group of properties.
