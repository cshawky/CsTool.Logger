    /// This is a bit of a story/history and the design dates back to 2012 with some overhang from C,C++ days of 2004.
    /// 
    /// This C# file provides an example of several SettingsModel classes to demonstrate the use of attributes and
    /// shared code to manage the retrieval and saving of properties from an XML file.
    /// 
    /// Attributes are being used to allow gradual abstraction of the CsTool.CoreUtilities feature for importing and
    /// exporting settings to/from file, without undue code writing. The author has not been comfortable with other generic
    /// mechanisms particularly where they require the import of third party packages or the use of built in .Net 
    /// functionality that is not very tolerant to user error. XML was selected many years ago when it was in favour.
    /// 
    /// The architecture assumes the MVVM or VMC design pattern. The Model contains global and instance specific properties
    /// and typically inherits a ModelSettings class that focuses on those properties and functionality related to permanent
    /// data store of the model data. As a minimum, it handles the single XML Settings File for that DLL or application. For
    /// each DLL there exists a single Model implemented using the Singleton Instance technique.
    /// 
    /// Model settings load/save techniques are currently spread across parallel code streams. The current thought pattern is
    /// now to centralise a core interface with CsTool.Logger rather than in the various customer implementations of CoreUtilities.
    /// CoreUtilities would also be merged across implementations but allow applications to be developed with CsTool.Logger and
    /// without CoreUtilities given other programmers might prefer to use their own code base other than the logger functionality
    /// herein.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// The SampleModelSettings class below demonstrates the use of each custom attribute.
    /// If this is the primary settings class for the DLL, then it should inherit <code>DefaultSettings</code>
    /// which currently resides in CsTool.CoreUtilities.
    /// TODO incorporate the equivalent of DefaultSettings class into CsTool.Logger so that this architecture
    /// will work independent to CoreUtilities. In this interim migration, the settings are handled through
    /// <code>AppDefaults</code> class. As may be seen, that class re introduces methods from CoreUtilities
    /// uplifting them to utilise System.Reflection more extensively.
    /// 
    /// The code would be something like:
    /// <code>SampleModelSettings SampleSettings1 = new SampleModelSettings();</code>
    /// 
    /// This settings class instance is represented in the XML File as follows:
    /// 
    /// <code>
    ///  <?xml...?>
    ///  <Settings version="x.y.x"...>
    ///     <AppDefaults>
